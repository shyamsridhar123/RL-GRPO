# Documentation Overview

This directory contains the primary documentation for the CPU-based GRPO implementation project.

## Primary Documents

### üìã **CONSOLIDATED_SCIENTIFIC_ASSESSMENT.md**
**Main comprehensive analysis** - Unified assessment covering technical implementation, scientific novelty evaluation, literature comparison, and publication readiness. This is the authoritative document for understanding the project's contributions and positioning.

### üîß **CPU_GRPO_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md** 
**Technical implementation details** - Detailed technical analysis of the CPU-optimized GRPO implementation, performance metrics, and engineering contributions.

## Supporting Documents

### üìö **APP_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md**
Codebase cleanup documentation and project maintenance notes.

### üìÅ **results/**
Experimental results, benchmark logs, and performance data.

## Scientific Positioning

This project represents **competent systems engineering** that successfully demonstrates the accessibility of GRPO training on consumer CPU hardware. It provides **practical value for education and accessibility** but does not constitute novel scientific research suitable for top-tier academic venues.

**Key Contributions:**
- Practical demonstration of CPU-based GRPO feasibility
- Comprehensive memory optimization for consumer hardware
- Educational accessibility and reproducible implementation
- Performance characterization for resource-constrained scenarios

## Archived Documentation

Historical analysis documents have been archived to `../archive/documentation_consolidation_2025-07-13/` to eliminate contradictions and maintain consistent scientific positioning. See the consolidation summary in that directory for details.
- **Speed constraints:** 0.004 samples/second limits practical dataset sizes
