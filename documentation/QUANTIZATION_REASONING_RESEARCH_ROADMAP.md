# Research Roadmap: Quantization Impact on Mathematical Reasoning

**Target:** First comprehensive study of quantization effects on mathematical reasoning capabilities

**Timeline:** 6 months to significant results, 12 months to top-tier publication

**Why This Will Break New Ground:** No systematic study exists of how quantization specifically affects mathematical reasoning vs. general language tasks

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Research Hypothesis**

**Primary Hypothesis:** "Mathematical reasoning degrades non-linearly with quantization precision, with specific reasoning types (e.g., multi-step calculations) being disproportionately affected."

**Secondary Hypotheses:**
1. Different mathematical operations have different quantization sensitivities
2. Reasoning accuracy correlates with specific model components' quantization
3. Task-specific quantization strategies can preserve reasoning while reducing memory

## ðŸ”¬ **Experimental Design**

### **Phase 1: Systematic Quantization Analysis (Month 1-2)**

**Experiment 1: Precision Sweep**
```python
# Test different quantization levels
quantization_levels = [
    "fp32",     # baseline
    "fp16",     # half precision
    "int8",     # our current implementation
    "int4",     # aggressive quantization
    "mixed"     # different precision for different layers
]

# Measure performance on:
- Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Multi-step word problems
- Algebraic reasoning
- Geometric reasoning
- Statistical reasoning
```

**Experiment 2: Component-wise Quantization**
```python
# Quantize different model components separately
components = [
    "attention_weights",
    "feed_forward_layers", 
    "embedding_layers",
    "output_layers"
]

# Measure impact of quantizing each component individually
```

**Experiment 3: Error Pattern Analysis**
```python
# Analyze failure modes
error_types = [
    "calculation_errors",      # wrong arithmetic
    "reasoning_errors",        # wrong steps
    "representation_errors",   # misunderstanding problem
    "precision_errors"         # rounding issues
]
```

### **Phase 2: Mathematical Operation Sensitivity (Month 3-4)**

**Experiment 4: Operation-Specific Testing**
```python
operation_types = {
    "arithmetic": ["addition", "subtraction", "multiplication", "division"],
    "algebraic": ["equation_solving", "variable_substitution"],
    "geometric": ["area_calculation", "angle_reasoning"],
    "statistical": ["probability", "averages", "distributions"],
    "logical": ["if_then_reasoning", "proof_steps"]
}

# Create targeted datasets for each operation type
# Measure quantization sensitivity per operation
```

**Experiment 5: Complexity Scaling**
```python
complexity_levels = [
    "single_step",    # 5 + 3 = ?
    "two_step",       # (5 + 3) * 2 = ?
    "multi_step",     # word problems with 3+ steps
    "nested",         # problems with sub-problems
    "abstract"        # algebraic reasoning
]

# Study how quantization effects scale with problem complexity
```

### **Phase 3: Adaptive Quantization Strategies (Month 5-6)**

**Experiment 6: Layer-wise Sensitivity**
```python
# Identify which layers are most critical for reasoning
layer_importance = {}
for layer in model.layers:
    # Measure reasoning degradation when layer is quantized
    # Create importance ranking
```

**Experiment 7: Task-Adaptive Quantization**
```python
# Develop quantization strategies based on task type
strategies = {
    "arithmetic_optimized": "preserve calculation layers",
    "reasoning_optimized": "preserve attention mechanisms", 
    "memory_optimized": "maximize compression",
    "balanced": "optimize for overall performance"
}
```
