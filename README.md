## Overview

This project implements Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for CPU-only training environments. GRPO is a reinforcement learning method for fine-tuning language models that typically requires GPU infrastructure. This implementation adapts the algorithm for consumer CPU hardware through memory optimization and efficient training strategies.

The project demonstrates that RL-based fine-tuning can be performed on accessible hardware, making it available for educational use and resource-constrained research scenarios.

## Technical Approach

The implementation combines existing optimization techniques to enable GRPO training on CPU:

- **Progressive training:** 3-stage curriculum learning approach
- **Memory optimization:** Post-training INT8 dynamic quantization and gradient checkpointing
- **Fisher Information:** Continual learning to prevent catastrophic forgetting
- **CPU acceleration:** Intel MKL and multi-core utilization (14 logical cores)
